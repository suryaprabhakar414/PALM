# PALM(Pathological Myopia)
This project focuses on the investigation and development of algorithms associated with the diagnosis of Pathological Myopia in fundus photos from PM patients. The goal of the project is to evaluate and compare Deep Learning algorithms for the detection of pathological myopia on a common dataset of retinal fundus images. 

In this Project I have used two Deep Learning Architectures:-

1)Residual Neural Network(ResNet50)

2)DenseNet(DenseNet121)
